Name of app: Guess
This app allows the user to enter a lower and upper bound. Once the user selects the bounds and hits
the 'Choose Random Number' button, the app selects a random number  between those
bounds inclusive. The user can then guess the number. When the user guesses a number too low, the app tells the user so and
vice  versa until the user has guessed the number.
